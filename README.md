# AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP
This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based AI chatbot that can understand and respond to user queries. It uses spaCy for text processing, Hugging Face Transformers for AI-based responses, and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion. The chatbot takes text input and provides intelligent responses while also speaking them aloud.
